Jarvis AI is a Python-powered voice assistant integrated with Arduino, capable of recognizing speech, responding intelligently, and controlling hardware components. It enhances user interaction by executing voice commands for tasks like web searches, Wikipedia lookups, and physical movements.

~ Features:


1. Speech Recognition â€“ Converts voice commands into text.

2. Text-to-Speech â€“ Generates human-like responses.

3. Arduino Integration â€“ Controls servos and sensors for real-world actions.

4. Web Search â€“ Fetches information from Wikipedia and Google.

5. Automation â€“ Can perform predefined tasks like opening websites.

6. Modular Design â€“ Easily expandable for future functionalities.

~ Technologies Used:


1. Python (SpeechRecognition, Pyttsx3, Wikipedia, Webbrowser)

2. Arduino (Servo control via PyFirmata)

3. Kivy (If later used for GUI development)
